# FrontEnd_Mentor_Newbie_Challenges_1

This repository features the first set of **Frontend Mentor** challenges I completed at the **newbie** difficulty level. These projects focus on mastering the basics of modern frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with an emphasis on responsive design and clean layouts.

### Links to the challenges I completed:

01. Ping single column coming soon page - https://ping-single-column-coming-soon-page-mu-ten.vercel.app/

02. Intro component with sign-up form - https://intro-component-with-sign-up-form-ruddy-beta.vercel.app/

09. Stats preview card component - https://stats-preview-card-five-mu.vercel.app/

Each project was deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and helped me practice essential frontend techniques including component-based layouts, basic interactivity, and responsive styling.

Iâ€™ll continue building more solutions and advancing through the challenge levels to grow as a frontend developer.
